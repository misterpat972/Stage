Things are getting normal, but still, we have to follow the guidelines to prevent ourselves and others from contacting the Covid-19 virus. As you know, during this pandemic are encouraged to socially distance themselves and remain quarantined in homes.</p>




<p>But what if you want to move outdoor, it can be for shopping for groceries, or it can be for other personal reasons. If you have to move outdoor during this pandemic time, we have some suggestions for you, if you follow these suggestions, I am sure you would not be contacted.</p>




<h2><span  ></span><strong>Before Traveling:</strong><span ></span></h2>



<p>Keep in mind, that COVID-19 is a global pandemic, it is everywhere, so if you are traveling, even though in America things are getting normalized, internationally Covid-19 restrictions are still applied, and you have to follow them religiously.</p>




<p>First of all, get your flu shot, and check your restriction, don’t forget to take your certificate, it can be in printed form or on your smartphone. Bring an extra supply of masks, as well as hand sanitizer, don’t forget to wear a mask.</p>



<p>Other rules are still here, don’t touch your mouth, nose, and forehead frequently. For testing too, you should get yourself tested by the Government verified authorities, otherwise, there are chances that they would not accept your testing, and maybe you could not be allowed to fly.</p>




<h2><span  ></span><strong>Be prepared for anything:</strong><span ></span></h2>



<p>One of the key health tips for traveling in covid is, to be prepared for anything. Pack smart, and be prepared for almost anything, expect the unexpected. There are a few things if you have to travel, you need to take along with you.</p>



<p>Hand sanitizer (Wash your hands often, even between the flights, the flight crew may have covid-19, and can infect you)</p>



<ul><li>High-protein snacks</li><li>Granola bars</li><li>Gum for chew</li><li>Cough syrup or drops</li><li>Eye masks, headphones</li><li>Extra blankets or sweaters</li></ul>



<p>All your medications, especially if you are a diabetic or a heart patient</p>



<p>On planes, you are allowed to take a carry with you, for the stuff mentioned, you should pack in the carrier so that you could get them accessed anytime.</p>



<h2><span  ></span><strong>Assess COVID-19 Rates at Your Destination:</strong><span ></span></h2>



<p>The infection rate where you are traveling can be one of the factors to determine whether or not you would be infected. If the destination you are traveling to is red hot, your chances are high, for that, you should refrain from visiting the place. This thing is applied within the United States and outside too, you can check the infection rate online, you a find n area’s test positivity rate.</p>



<p>If you are traveling internationally, you should check whether or not you are allowed to travel to that particular country. Because some countries are restricted due to their high infection rate. You can visit the US State department website for that and determine the virus rate.</p>



<h2><span  ></span><strong>Your Host’s vaccination Status:</strong><span ></span></h2>



<p>Yes, that’s a pertinent thing too. First, ask yourself how risky could be that travel for you? Here things are different, now everything is visualized from the perspective of COVID-19. You are responsible for your personal benefits, and view everything from your personal perspective.</p>



<p>I am sure you are vaccinated, but the person or the people are traveling to meet are vaccinated too. What is their age, and their health conditions? If they are ready to meet you without any condition, or without they being known you are vaccinated or not, you should never meet any person if he/she is not vaccinated, maybe they got a great immune system, but you can get infected anytime, not only you but your loved ones too.</p>



<p>So, refrain from visiting or meeting people through busy airports, gatherings, crowded resorts, or vaccinations spots, these can be risky and you may get infected.</p>



<h2><span  ></span><strong>Cleaning Obesity:</strong><span ></span></h2>



<p>I have seen many obsess with cleaning more than required. Like, if you are out there on vacation, you have to stay in hotels and enjoy yourself. You can’t be highly obsessed with cleaning and meeting Hotel staff for their regular work if you are already out there.</p>



<p>One thing you should keep in your mind, if you are vaccinated, you can vacation pretty much as usual. That means you can stay in a regular hotel or in a room you prefer, don’t isolate yourself to rental homes.</p>



<p>No need to wipe down hotels’ walls, doors, light switches, doorknobs, and other highly sensitive touch places. But if you are unvaccinated, you might have to take some extra measures, but it would not be ideal to stay in hotels if you are unvaccinated.</p>



<h2><span  ></span><strong>Eating:</strong><span ></span></h2>



<p>Suppose you are staying in a hotel for your business or personal reasons, what about eating during this Pandemic time? How should you dine, should you order food in your room, and eat in the isolated spaces? I asked many health experts, and they had the advice for vaccinated to dine outside.</p>



<p>But if you have a compromised immune system and are not vaccinated, you still try not to dine outside, and order food in your room.</p>



<h2><span  ></span><strong>Avoid Indoor gatherings:</strong><span ></span></h2>



<p>If you are staying out of the United States where the vaccination rate is very slow, and the infection rate is very high, you should try not to attend the indoor gathering. In my view, if you could skip those gatherings, or skip those tours, that would be ideal for you. But if you can’t don’t indoor the gathering where people are cremated to each other and gossip like there is nothing happened.</p>



<p>But in the United States things are better, with the highest vaccination ratio, and decreasing infection rate, you still can take a risk of attending an indoor gathering, only if you are vaccinated.</p>



<h2><span  ></span><strong>Have a Good Time:</strong><span ></span></h2>



<p>Having a good time after a long social distance, and travel restriction is really something you are looking for. If you are lucky enough, I am sure you will be vaccinated, and the people with you too, you should have a good time. Don’t spend your time cleaning obsessions, if you are vaccinated, you do not need to be worried.</p>
